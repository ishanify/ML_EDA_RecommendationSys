# Recommendation Sys using MovieLens Data set
Project on eCommerce recommender system using the Movie Lens data set. Using machine learning algorithms, the system should be able to recommend a list of items to the user based on the reviews provided by other users, product descriptions and user's own history.

(Exploratory Data Analysis)[/EDA_and_Cleaning.ipynb] is done to understand the data set and missing values and outliers are identified and dealt with.


The data set is splitted into trianing and test sets. Then the machine learning algorithms and Collaborative and Content based filtering approch are developed.

The ML models are evaluated and tested.
